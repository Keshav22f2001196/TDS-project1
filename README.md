- **Data Extraction Process**: We leveraged the GitHub API to gather comprehensive user and repository data from developers in Dublin with over 50 followers. Each userâ€™s personal details and up to 500 repositories were collected, covering essential activity metrics and developer engagement.

- **Interesting Finding**: JavaScript emerged as the dominant language, yet MDX boasted the highest average star rating per repository, indicating a niche yet high-engagement interest in content-focused development within a coding-centric community.

- **Actionable Recommendation**: For developers aiming to increase visibility, MDX offers a unique opportunity to stand out due to its engagement level relative to its usage. Diversifying with content-driven projects could increase audience interest and engagement.
